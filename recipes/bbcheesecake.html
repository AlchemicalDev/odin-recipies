        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
        <p>Swirling blueberry puree into cheesecake batter isn't only beautiful, it's extremely delicious. The cheesecake stays extra-creamy and has the perfect tartness to it that will have you saying, "just one more bite," another thousand times. It's the perfect ending to an outdoor dinner and though the cheesecake is just as rich the fresh fruit brings a welcome brightness to it making it one of our favorite summer desserts. </p>
