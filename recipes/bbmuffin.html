        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
        <p>These blueberry muffins are quick and easy with a moist and tender center bursting with blueberries and perfectly golden brown top. They are extra easy to make, too.</p>

        <h3><em>Ingredients:</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup softened butter</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 cups blueberries, washed, drained and picked over</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><em>Steps:</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until light.
            </li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla.</li>
            <li>Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder, and add to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.
            </li>
            <li>Crush 1/2 cup blueberries with a fork, and mix into the batter. Fold in the remaining whole berries.</li>
            <li>Line a 12 cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners, and fill with batter. Sprinkle the 3 teaspoons sugar over the tops of the muffins, and bake at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove muffins from tin and cool at least 30 minutes. Store, uncovered, or the muffins will be too moist the second day, if they last that long.</li>
        </ol>
